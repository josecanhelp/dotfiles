# JoseCanHelp

I'm a vim-loving dev and I try my best to automate as much as I can. Hopefully, you find a golden nugget here and there as you search for ways to improve your configurations.

Find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/josecanhelp).

If you happen to copy anything from this repository or if you are inspired by this repository to do something your own customized way, please link back to this repo in yours. I will do the same for the folks I have "borrowed" from. Cheers!

## Framework

I use the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) framework to manage symlinks and new system initialization. I highly recommned using this framework because it mostly stays out of my way, provides an easy to understand yaml config file, and I don't have to maintain my own scripts.

## Vim

### Managing Plugins

I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my Vim plugins. You can watch [my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRxGH2HA2_8) to see how easy it is to use.

## Terminal

- iTerm
- tmux
- zsh shell
- [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/)

## Keyboard Mapping

[Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) are used heavily to completely re-bind modifier+keys across applications. I also make use of [modals](https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.hotkey.modal.html) to add multiple layers to my keyboard beyond modifiers.
